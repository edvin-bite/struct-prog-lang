pizza duck the five behind
^ all these words are in the vocabulary, but not in this order.

expressions are the correct use of the vocabulary:
 - expression = {digits}
 - expression = expression <digit>
 - expression = expression "+" expression

first example: expression = {digit}
ends with a terminal     terminal^

expression may also be translated to be seen as problem and sub-problems.

keep applying rules on expressions until all of them are "terminals" and you have a sequence of terminals
